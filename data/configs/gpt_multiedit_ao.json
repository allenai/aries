The relationship is many-to-many; one comment could correspond to several edits, and several comment could correspond to the same edit.  There could also be comments that the authors didn't address at all or edits that were not made in response to any particular comment.\n\nWrite the answer as JSON lines with the format {\"comment_id\": <comment id>, \"edit_ids\": [<edit ids>], \"notes\": \"\"} where each record has a comment id and the list of edit ids that correspond to it.  The \"notes\" field is optional and can contain any notes about edits you weren't sure about or reasons for including/omitting certain edits."
